<#
.SYNOPSIS
Deploys tenant-level resources, specifically the Azure AD application registration.

.DESCRIPTION
This script deploys the 'auth.bicep' template to the tenant scope.
It should be run once by a user with sufficient permissions (e.g., Global Administrator)
to create an AAD application registration. The outputs of this script are
required inputs for the environment-specific infrastructure deployments.

.EXAMPLE
./deploy-tenant.ps1

.NOTES
- Requires Azure CLI to be installed and authenticated (`az login`).
- The user running this script needs permissions to create AAD applications.
