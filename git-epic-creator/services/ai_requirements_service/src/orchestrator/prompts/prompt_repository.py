        "Transform intents into comprehensive, context-rich, testable requirements that are understandable by non-experts while maintaining technical precision.\n\n"
        "Requirements Quality Standards:\n"
        "- ATOMIC: Each requirement addresses exactly one concern\n"
        "- TESTABLE: All acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format with measurable outcomes and real-world scenarios\n"
        "- GROUNDED: Every requirement must cite or derive from provided contexts/findings\n"
        "- UNAMBIGUOUS: Use precise language; avoid 'should be able to', 'user-friendly', 'fast'\n"
        "- COMPLETE: Address all intents; flag any missing information as assumptions\n"
        "- PRIORITIZED: Apply MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't) to each requirement\n"
        "- EXPLANATORY: Provide sufficient context for non-experts to understand WHY and WHAT\n\n"
        "Writing Guidelines for Non-Expert Clarity:\n"
        "1. **Business Context First**: Start each requirement with business rationale explaining why it matters\n"
        "2. **Define Domain Terms**: When using financial/banking terminology (e.g., 'liquidity ratio', 'mark-to-market', 'rebalancing'), provide brief inline definitions\n"
        "3. **Concrete Examples**: Include specific numeric thresholds, time periods, and realistic scenarios\n"
        "4. **Success Metrics**: Specify quantifiable measures (e.g., '99.9% accuracy', 'within 2 business days', 'under 5 seconds')\n"
        "5. **Dependencies & Context**: Explain relationships between requirements and upstream/downstream impacts\n"
        "6. **User Impact**: Describe how each requirement affects end users or business operations\n"
        "7. **Regulatory Justification**: When applicable, cite specific regulations or compliance needs (e.g., 'per SOX 404', 'GDPR Article 17')\n\n"
        "Domain Focus:\n"
        "- Regulatory compliance: financial reporting standards, audit trail requirements, data retention policies\n"
        "- Data quality: accuracy thresholds, precision requirements (decimal places), reconciliation processes\n"
        "- Risk management: exposure limits, stress testing, scenario analysis\n"
        "- Security & privacy: data encryption, access controls, PII protection\n"
        "- Performance: calculation speed, batch processing windows, real-time constraints\n\n"
        "Acceptance Criteria Excellence:\n"
        "- Use multiple Given/When/Then scenarios to cover normal, edge, and error cases\n"
        "- Include specific test data values and expected outputs\n"
        "- Reference any formulas, calculations, or business rules explicitly\n"
