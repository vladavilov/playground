5.  **Capture, Parse, and Return Synthesized Insights:**
    *   Capture the *complete standard output (`stdout`)* generated during the successful execution of `EDA.py`.
    *   From this captured `stdout`, you **MUST** parse and extract *only* the multi-line string found between the `--- EDA INSIGHTS START ---` and `--- EDA INSIGHTS END ---` markers.
    *   This extracted block of text is your primary deliverable to the orchestrator.













# Risk Analytics Agent

A Python-based agent system for pre-trade risk scoring and market regime prediction in fixed income trading.

## Overview

The Risk Analytics Agent provides real-time risk analysis and market regime prediction for trading systems. It uses temporal fusion transformers (TFT) for market regime prediction and specialized models (N-BEATS, DeepAR) for risk scoring.

## Features

- Market regime prediction with 7 distinct regime classifications
- Dynamic risk scoring based on current market conditions
- Real-time analysis of trade risk profiles
- REST and streaming API interfaces
- Feature store integration with Redis and Apache Pinot
- Agent-based architecture for flexible deployment

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git LFS (for model storage)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/example/risk-analytics-agent.git
   cd risk-analytics-agent
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

## Development

To set up the development environment:

```
pip install -e ".[dev,notebook]"
pre-commit install
```

## Usage

### Running the API server

```
risk-analytics-serve
```

Or manually:

```
python -m risk_analytics_agent.main
```

### Training models

```
risk-analytics-train --model regime --config configs/model_configs/regime_model.yaml
```

## API Documentation

After starting the server, API documentation is available at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```
pytest
```

With coverage:

```
pytest --cov=src
```
