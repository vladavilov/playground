Risk is a multi-faceted concept. Your agent would need to account for, at a minimum:
Interest Rate Risk: This is the most basic. If the Fed moves rates, what happens to your bond's price? We measure this with Duration (a first-order approximation) and Convexity (a second-order effect). The key metric here is DV01 (Dollar Value of a 01 basis point move) â€“ it tells you exactly how much money you'll make or lose if rates shift by 0.01%. Any risk model has to start here.
Credit Spread Risk: The bond's yield is its yield-to-maturity, which is composed of the risk-free rate plus a "spread." That spread is the compensation for the risk of default. This spread can widen (bad for your position) or tighten (good) for many reasons: company-specific news, sector trends, or general market "risk-on/risk-off" sentiment. We measure this with CS01 (Credit Spread 01). Your agent would need to understand the drivers of credit spreads for the specific asset.
Liquidity Risk: This is critical and often the hardest to model. A bond might have a great theoretical price, but if you can't sell it without taking a significant haircut, that price is a fantasy. How would your agent assess liquidity? By looking at the bid-ask spread? Recent trade volumes (TRACE data)? The number of dealers making a market? In the MUNI market, some bonds might not trade for months. That's the ultimate liquidity risk.
Event Risk: This is the risk of a sudden, unexpected event. A company announces an acquisition, a municipality faces a fiscal crisis, a rating agency issues a surprise downgrade. This is where traditional quantitative models often fail and where a GenAI that can process unstructured data (news feeds, research reports, regulatory filings) could theoretically have an edge.
