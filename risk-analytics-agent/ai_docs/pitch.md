**Pitch for the Risk Analytics Decision-Support System**

When GenerativeAI entered the scene, and I started learning it, its fundamental principles, math, architecture. I found that the core idea behind AI models is about looking for patterns and relations in massive datasets, that are too complex and subtle for the human brain to detect.

So, the first thing came to my mind was a huge amount of securities data and trading statistics we have in caesar, a perfect environment for AI to analyze. I started researching how to apply it in risks analysis. 

I started with a simple idea: show a model historical trades and have it score upcoming trades for potential loss. But after talking with our business analysts, I learned that this wasn't quite what fixed-income traders needed. It wasn't about a simple "red-light, green-light" system.

So, I continued to research, asking into the real-world workflow, and developed the concept and documentation for the system I want to present today.

### **The System: A Proactive Risk Co-Pilot**

What I'm proposing is not another black box. It's a **decision-support tool** designed to augment the intelligence of our traders. Think of it as a sharp junior analyst for your desk, available on-demand, 24/7.

It's an system that automates the quantitative heavy lifting. It aggregates data, incorporates financial news sentiment, predicts key risk features, and synthesizes the results into a single briefing. By systematically handling the data and the drivers for that data, system should free traders to focus on what I cannot automate: strategy, execution, and managing the "what's next?" question.

### **The "What": Key Risk Indicators at a Glance**

To be clear, when I say "risk features," I'm not talking about vague concepts. The system calculates and forecasts the metrics that (I think), should drive traders daily decisions. This includes:

*   **Core Analytics:** Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS), DV01, and CS01.
*   **Market-Derived Indicators:** Spread volatility and forward-looking liquidity scores based on historical trade data.
*   **Funding & Carry:** Cost-of-carry metrics derived from repo rates.

### **The Output: A Clear, Actionable Briefing**

The final output—the "briefing"—is designed for flexibility and ease of use. It's not one-size-fits-all. We can deliver this analysis as:

*   An **interactive HTML dashboard** for deep-dive exploration.
*   A concise, shareable **PDF report** for morning meetings or client discussions.
*   An **API endpoint** to integrate these insights directly into other systems on the desk.

*(A mock-up of the dashboard/report would be inserted here)*


To achieve this, my idea is to combine old-school calculations with modern AI models. The system's flow is built specifically for the fixed income trading domain.

At the heart of forecasting engine is an **explainable Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model**. This allows to predict the key risk metrics mentioned above over multiple time horizons with high accuracy.

These forecasts are context-aware and future-aware. I use a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** to first classify the prevailing market state—like a `Bear_Flattener` or `Bull_Steepener`—ensuring risk predictions are relevant to the current environment. This, combined with financial news sentiment and the economic calendar, allows the TFT model to forecast risk features with even greater precision.

For me, this is a chance to build a modern system that has modern techologies working for business needs, to have a more proactive, data-driven, and efficient work for trading desk.
