**Pitch for the Risk Analytics Decision-Support System**

I've always been driven by technology challenges, constantly looking for what's next. When GenAI entered the scene, I dove in, wanting to understand not just the hype, but the fundamental principles. I found that the core idea behind these models is about searching for patterns in massive datasets; patterns too complex and subtle for the human brain to detect.

When I realized that, the first thing that came to my mind was our work here at Caesar. We have an enormous amount of securities data, trading statistics, and market information. It's a perfect environment for GenAI to analyze. My thinking was that these patterns could have many applications, but for me, the most compelling area was risk.

I started with a simple idea: train a model on historical trades and have it score upcoming trades for potential loss. But after talking with our business analysts, I learned that this wasn't quite what fixed-income traders needed for their day-to-day work. It wasn't about a simple "red-light, green-light" system.

So, I went back to the drawing board, dug deeper into the real-world workflow, and developed the concept and documentation for the system I want to present today.

### **The System: A Proactive Risk Co-Pilot**

What I'm proposing is not an auto-trader or another black box. It's a **decision-support tool** designed to augment the intelligence of our traders. Think of it as an exceptionally sharp junior analyst for your desk, available on-demand, 24/7.

It's an analytical system that automates the quantitative heavy lifting. It aggregates data, incorporates financial news sentiment, predicts key risk features, and synthesizes the results into a single, comprehensive briefing. By systematically handling the "what" (the data) and the "why" (the drivers), it frees up traders to focus on what they do best: strategy, execution, and managing the "what now?".

### **The "What": Key Risk Indicators at a Glance**

To be clear, when I say "risk features," I'm not talking about vague concepts. The system calculates and forecasts the precise, tangible metrics that drive our daily decisions. This includes:

*   **Core Analytics:** Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS), DV01, and CS01.
*   **Market-Derived Indicators:** Spread volatility and forward-looking liquidity scores based on historical trade data.
*   **Funding & Carry:** Cost-of-carry metrics derived from repo rates.

### **The Output: A Clear, Actionable Briefing**

The final output—the "briefing"—is designed for flexibility and ease of use. It's not one-size-fits-all. We can deliver this analysis as:

*   An **interactive HTML dashboard** for deep-dive exploration.
*   A concise, shareable **PDF report** for morning meetings or client discussions.
*   An **API endpoint** to integrate these insights directly into other systems on the desk.

*(A mock-up of the dashboard/report would be inserted here)*

### **The Foundation: Trusted Data Sources**

The model's intelligence is built on a foundation of high-quality, relevant data. We are integrating a wide array of feeds, including:

*   **Internal Data:** Our own Security Master and historical Trades History.
*   **Market Data Feeds:** Real-time market data (e.g., VIX, credit spreads).
*   **Economic & News Feeds:** The Economic Calendar for scheduled events and a News Sentiment feed to capture market narrative.
*   **Specialized Data:** a State Fiscal Health feed for municipal bond analysis.

### **Business Value & Objectives**

The goals are simple and directly tied to performance and efficiency:

*   **Augment Trader Intelligence:** Equip every trader with an on-demand analyst that delivers a holistic risk assessment for any instrument—covering both **Municipal Bonds and Taxable Fixed Income** products.
*   **Challenge Biases & Uncover Hidden Risk:** The system is designed to systematically surface non-obvious risks and contradictions. For example, it will flag when a bond is becoming illiquid while its valuation is still high, or when market sentiment is moving against the prevailing order flow. This forces a deeper look and challenges comfortable assumptions.
*   **Boost Efficiency & Coverage:** This tool acts as an invaluable "first look," allowing traders and analysts to screen opportunities and risks across the market far more efficiently. It helps you quickly identify instruments that warrant a deeper, qualitative dive.
*   **Build Trust through Transparency:** This is not a black box. Every forecast and analysis is delivered with a clear explanation of the key drivers behind it. This transparency is critical for validating the model's output against a trader's own market experience and intuition.

### **Innovative Technology at its Core**

To achieve this, we're leveraging old-school calculations combined with modern technologies. The system's architecture is built specifically for the fixed income trading domain.

At the heart of our forecasting engine is an **explainable Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model**. This allows us to predict the key risk metrics mentioned above over multiple time horizons with high accuracy.

Crucially, these forecasts are context-aware and future-aware. We use a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** to first classify the prevailing market state—like a `Bear_Flattener` or `Bull_Steepener`—ensuring our risk predictions are relevant to the current environment. This, combined with financial news sentiment and the economic calendar, allows the model to forecast risk features with even greater precision.

For me, this is a chance to build a modern system that continuously sharpens UBS's competitive edge. It's an investment in a more proactive, data-driven, and efficient future for our trading desk.
