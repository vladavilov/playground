# Market Data Feed Requirements

**Version: 1.0**

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the **Market Data Feed**, which is the sole source of input data for the **Market Regime Classification Model**. The primary purpose of this feed is to provide a consistent, reliable, and timely stream of financial and economic indicators necessary for the model to perform its real-time and historical classification tasks.

### 1.2. Scope
These requirements exclusively cover the sourcing, processing, and delivery of the input indicators listed in this document. The internal logic of the consuming system (the Market Regime Classification Model) is out of scope.

## 2. Data Dictionary & Schema

### 2.1. Data Requirements
- **MDF-DR-01:** The Market Data Feed **shall** provide the following indicators as a single data object for each requested timestamp.
- **MDF-DR-02:** All indicators **shall** be delivered as `float` data types.
- **MDF-DR-03:** The feed **shall** guarantee that no values are null or missing. The data ingestion service is responsible for handling any upstream data gaps.

## 3. Data Sourcing & System Architecture

### 3.1. Architectural Mandate
- **MDF-AR-01:** As per requirement **MR-NFR-01**, a dedicated **Market Data Ingestion Service** **shall** be implemented and used to source all externally-provided indicators.
- **MDF-AR-02:** The Market Regime Classification Model **shall not** connect directly to any external data vendor. It **shall** consume data exclusively from the Market Data Ingestion Service.

### 3.2. Sourcing Requirements
- **MDF-SR-01:** The Market Data Ingestion Service **shall** source each indicator from the systems and vendors specified in the table below.
- **MDF-SR-02:** The service **shall** be responsible for all vendor API integration, authentication, and data normalization.

| Feature Name                     | Source System         | Primary Source / Ticker                                       |
|:---------------------------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vix_index`                      | External Data Vendor  | **CBOE** (e.g., `VIX Index`)                                  |
| `move_index`                     | External Data Vendor  | **ICE/BofA** (e.g., `MOVE Index`)                             |
| `investment_grade_credit_spread` | External Data Vendor  | **Bloomberg** (e.g., LQD ETF spread vs. Treasury)             |
| `high_yield_credit_spread`       | External Data Vendor  | **Bloomberg** (e.g., HYG ETF spread vs. Treasury)             |
| `tips_breakeven_5y`              | External Data Vendor  | **U.S. Treasury / FRED** (Ticker: `T5YIE`)                    |
| `swap_spread_10y`                | External Data Vendor  | Market Data Aggregator (e.g., **Bloomberg**)                  |
| `muni_fund_flows_net`            | External Data Vendor  | **Refinitiv Lipper** or **ICI**                               |
| `us_cpi_yoy`                     | External Data Vendor  | **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**                     |

## 4. Data Delivery Contract

### 4.1. Real-Time Delivery
- **MDF-DC-01:** For real-time requests, the Market Data Ingestion Service **shall** provide the data via a synchronous API call.
- **MDF-DC-02:** The API response **shall** conform to the following JSON schema, containing the timestamp of the data and a flat object of the required indicators.

```json
{
  "data_timestamp": "datetime",
  "market_indicators": {
    "vix_index": "float",
    "move_index": "float",
    "investment_grade_credit_spread": "float",
    "high_yield_credit_spread": "float",
    "tips_breakeven_5y": "float",
    "swap_spread_10y": "float",
    "muni_fund_flows_net": "float",
    "us_cpi_yoy": "float"
  }
}
```

### 4.2. Historical Delivery
- **MDF-DC-03:** For historical data requests, the service **shall** provide a file (e.g., CSV) containing a `timestamp` column and a column for each of the eight indicators.
- **MDF-DC-04:** The column headers in the historical file **shall** exactly match the field names specified in the data dictionary (Section 2.1).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Timeliness & Freshness
- **MDF-NFR-01:** For the **Real-Time Mode**, the `data_timestamp` for any provided data point **should** be no more than 60 minutes older than the request time.
- **MDF-NFR-02:** The end-to-end latency for the real-time API call (from request to response) **should** be under 500ms.

### 5.2. Reliability & Availability
- **MDF-NFR-03:** The Market Data Ingestion Service API **shall** have an availability of 99.9% or higher.
- **MDF-NFR-04:** The service **shall** implement robust error handling and logging for failures in connecting to or retrieving data from any upstream source.
- **MDF-NFR-05:** The service **shall** include a health check endpoint for monitoring purposes.
