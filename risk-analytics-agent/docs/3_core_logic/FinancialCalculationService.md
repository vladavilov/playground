# Financial Calculation Engine: Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Purpose
This document defines the data models, sources, and calculation methodologies required to produce a comprehensive financial data object for a single fixed-income instrument. This process can be executed for the **current, real-time state** or for any **historical date**, providing a consistent output for trend analysis and back-testing. The output object serves as the standardized input for all downstream risk analysis, forecasting, and narrative generation systems.

## 2. System-Level Requirements

### 2.1. Operating Modes
The calculation service must support two distinct operating modes:
- **FR-01:** The system **shall** operate in **Current Mode**, using the most recent, real-time information available for all inputs.
- **FR-02:** The system **shall** operate in **Historical Mode**, accepting a specific date as a parameter and sourcing all input data (`SecurityMaster`, `MarketData`, `TradeHistory`) *as of* that specified historical date.

### 2.2. Data Sourcing
- **FR-03:** The system **shall** consolidate input data from the following market-wide data providers: **msrb, trace, bloomberg, ice**.

## 4. Core Logic & Business Rules
This section defines the key business logic, formulas, and methodologies for transforming input data into the calculated features.

### 4.1. Business Rule: Benchmark Selection
The choice of benchmark is critical and determined by the instrument's type and tax status:
- **BR-01:** The **UST Benchmark** **shall** be used for `instrument_type` in ('TFI_CORPORATE', 'TFI_AGENCY') and for `instrument_type` = 'MUNI' with `tax_status` = 'TAXABLE'.
- **BR-02:** The **MMD Benchmark** **shall** be used for `instrument_type` = 'MUNI' with `tax_status` in ('TAX_EXEMPT_FEDERAL', 'AMT', 'TAX_EXEMPT_FEDERAL_AND_STATE').
- **BR-03:** **No Benchmark** is applicable for `instrument_type` = 'TFI_TREASURY'. Spread-based calculations (OAS, Relative Value) are not applicable and their results shall be 0 or null.

### 4.2. Business Rule: Data Enrichment from Services
- **BR-04:** The system **shall** enrich the final `FinancialDataObject` by directly mapping values or performing calculations based on input from data services.
  - The `ownership` object **shall** be populated by performing the concentration calculation defined in Section 4.3 on the raw data from the `OwnershipDataService`.
  - The `financing.cost_of_carry_bps` **shall** be populated from the output of the `RepoDataService`.
  - The `market_context` fields `investment_grade_credit_spread`, `high_yield_credit_spread`, and `muni_fund_flows_net` **shall** be populated directly from the `GeneralMarketData` input object.

### 4.3. Methodology: Ownership Concentration Calculation
- **Purpose (Trader View):** To identify hidden liquidity risk. If a small number of entities hold a large percentage of the issue, a decision by a single holder to sell can disproportionately impact the price.
- **Input Model:** The `holders` array from the `OwnershipDataService` output.
- **Logic:**
    1.  Sort the `holders` array by `ownership_pct` in descending order.
    2.  Sum the `ownership_pct` of the top 3 holders to calculate `top_3_holders_pct`.
    3.  Apply **Business Rule BR-05** to set the `is_concentrated_flag`.
- **BR-05:** The `ownership.is_concentrated_flag` **shall** be set to `true` if `top_3_holders_pct` is greater than or equal to 60.0. Otherwise, it **shall** be `false`.

### 4.4. Business Rule: Peer Group Identification
- **BR-06:** A peer group of comparable bonds **shall** be identified for relative value analysis. The peer universe is determined based on the specified calculation date (current or historical).
- **Logic:**
    1.  **Filter Criteria:**
        -   **`instrument_type`:** Must be an exact match.
        -   **State:** (for `instrument_type` = 'MUNI' only) Exact match.
        -   **Sector/Industry:** Exact match.
        -   **Maturity:** Within ±2 years of the target bond.
    2.  **Validation:** The group must contain at least 3 comparables. If not, relax filters in this order: 1) Rating (allow ±1 notch), 2) Maturity (widen to ±3 years).
- **Rating Notch Definition:** To programmatically handle "±1 notch", the following ordinal rating scale **shall** be used. A difference of 1 on this scale is one notch.

| Rating (S&P/Fitch) | Rating (Moody's) | Scale Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| AAA | Aaa | 1 |
| AA+ | Aa1 | 2 |
| AA | Aa2 | 3 |
| AA- | Aa3 | 4 |
| A+ | A1 | 5 |
| A | A2 | 6 |
| A- | A3 | 7 |
| BBB+ | Baa1 | 8 |
| BBB | Baa2 | 9 |
| BBB- | Baa3 | 10 |

*Lower ratings follow a similar pattern*

- **Output:** A list of CUSIPs for the identified peers.

### 4.5. Formula: Liquidity Score Calculation
- **Purpose:** To generate a single, normalized score representing an instrument's market liquidity.
- **Formula:**
  $$
  \text{Score} = (0.4 \times \text{Bid/Ask Spread Score}) + (0.4 \times \text{Composite Volume Score}) + (0.2 \times \text{Composite Dealer Count Score})
  $$
- **Component Logic:**
    - All "sector average" metrics (for spread, volume, dealer count) **shall** be calculated by taking the average of that metric across all bonds in the peer group identified in Section 4.4.
    - **Bid/Ask Spread Score:** The instrument's current bid/ask spread (in bps) is normalized against its sector average (z-score). This is a point-in-time metric.
    - **Composite Trade Volume Score:** This is a weighted average of normalized scores from multiple time horizons.
        - `Score_1d` = z-score of `t1d.total_par_volume` vs. sector average 1-day volume.
        - `Score_5d` = z-score of `t5d.total_par_volume` vs. sector average 5-day volume.
        - `Score_20d` = z-score of `t20d.total_par_volume` vs. sector average 20-day volume.
        - **Final Score:**
          $$
          \text{Composite Volume Score} = (0.2 \times \text{Score}_{1d}) + (0.5 \times \text{Score}_{5d}) + (0.3 \times \text{Score}_{20d})
          $$
    - **Composite Dealer Count Score:** This is a weighted average of normalized scores from multiple time horizons.
        - `Score_1d` = z-score of `t1d.unique_dealer_count` vs. sector average 1-day dealer count.
        - `Score_5d` = z-score of `t5d.unique_dealer_count` vs. sector average 5-day dealer count.
        - `Score_20d` = z-score of `t20d.unique_dealer_count` vs. sector average 20-day dealer count.
        - **Final Score:**
          $$
          \text{Composite Dealer Count Score} = (0.2 \times \text{Score}_{1d}) + (0.5 \times \text{Score}_{5d}) + (0.3 \times \text{Score}_{20d})
          $$
- **Output:** A single float value representing the composite liquidity score.

#### 4.5.1. Business Rule: Illiquidity Flag
- **BR-07:** The `is_illiquid_flag` **shall** be set to `true` if the calculated `liquidity.composite_score` is less than -1.5. This threshold indicates that the instrument's liquidity is significantly below the average of its peer group. Otherwise, the flag **shall** be `false`.

### 4.6. Methodology: Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) Calculation
- **Purpose:** To calculate the spread over a benchmark yield curve that equates a bond's theoretical price (accounting for embedded call options) to its observed market price.
- **Input Model:**
    - `market_price`: `float`
    - `cash_flows`: `array` (derived from SecurityMaster)
    - `call_schedule`: `array` (from SecurityMaster, including `call_type`)
    - `benchmark_yield_curve`: `object` (from the `GeneralMarketData` model - the appropriate UST or MMD curve as per rule BR-01/BR-02)
    - `interest_rate_volatility_surface`: `object` (from the `GeneralMarketData` model)
- **Calculation Method:**
    1.  This calculation is not performed for `instrument_type` = 'TFI_TREASURY'.
    2.  An `interest_rate_volatility` float **shall** be derived from the input `interest_rate_volatility_surface`. The logic is as follows:
        -   The goal is to find the implied volatility that corresponds to the bond's duration at an at-the-money strike.
        -   From the volatility surface, which is a matrix of tenor and strike, select the volatilities for the 'at-the-money' strike (e.g., strike = 100).
        -   Using this list of volatilities keyed by tenor, perform a **linear interpolation** to find the volatility at the specific duration of the bond. This is identical to the benchmark yield interpolation logic in Section 4.8.
    3.  A binomial interest rate lattice is constructed based on the instrument's appropriate benchmark yield curve and the interpolated `interest_rate_volatility` derived in the previous step. This lattice models the potential paths of future interest rates.
    4.  The bond's cash flows are valued backwards through the lattice, from maturity to the present.
    5.  At each node representing a call date, the model checks if the issuer's optimal action is to call the bond based on its `call_type` (e.g., if the bond's price is higher than its call price for an American call). The cash flow is adjusted accordingly.
    6.  A numerical root-finding solver is used to find the `OAS` value. The `OAS` is the constant spread that, when added to all interest rates in the lattice, makes the calculated present value of the bond equal to its current `market_price`.
- **Output:** A single float value, `oas_in_bps`.

### 4.7. Methodology: Trade History Aggregation
- **Purpose:** To process the raw trade list from the `TradeHistory` input into structured summaries for multiple time horizons (1-day, 5-day, 20-day).
- **Input:** A list of trade objects from `TradeHistory` for the last 20 trading days.
- **Output:** The `trade_history_summary` object as defined in the Output Model (Section 3.2).
- **Calculation Logic:**
    - The following aggregations are performed independently for three filtered lists of trades: those within the last 1 day, 5 days, and 20 days.
        - `total_par_volume`: Sum of `par_volume` for all trades in the filtered list.
        - `trade_count`: Total count of trade objects in the filtered list.
        - `unique_dealer_count`: Count of unique `dealer_id` values from all trades in the filtered list.
        - `block_trade_par_volume`: Sum of `par_volume` for trades where `trade_size_category` is 'BLOCK'.
        - `odd_lot_par_volume`: Sum of `par_volume` for trades where `trade_size_category` is 'ODD_LOT'.
        - `customer_buy_par_volume`: Sum of `par_volume` for trades where `counterparty_type` is 'CUSTOMER_BUY'.
        - `customer_sell_par_volume`: Sum of `par_volume` for trades where `counterparty_type` is 'CUSTOMER_SELL'.
        - `high_trade_price`: The maximum `price` from all trades in the filtered list.
        - `low_trade_price`: The minimum `price` from all trades in the filtered list.
        - `trade_price_volatility`: Calculated as:
          $$ \text{Trade Price Volatility} = \frac{\text{High Trade Price} - \text{Low Trade Price}}{\text{Low Trade Price}} $$

### 4.8. Methodology: Benchmark Yield Interpolation
- **Purpose:** To determine the precise benchmark yield for a bond's specific duration when that duration falls between the standard tenors of the benchmark curve.
- **Method:** The system **shall** use **linear interpolation** to calculate the yield.
- **Logic:**
    1. Identify the bond's duration (`modified_duration` or `effective_duration`, whichever is calculated).
    2. From the appropriate benchmark curve (`UST` or `MMD`), find the two consecutive tenors (`T_lower`, `T_upper`) that bracket the bond's duration. Let their corresponding yields be `Y_lower` and `Y_upper`.
    3. Calculate the interpolated yield using the following formula:
       $$ \text{Interpolated Yield} = Y_{\text{lower}} + \left( \frac{\text{Bond Duration} - T_{\text{lower}}}{T_{\text{upper}} - T_{\text{lower}}} \right) \times (Y_{\text{upper}} - Y_{\text{lower}}) $$
- **Edge Case Handling:**
    - If the bond's duration is less than the shortest tenor on the benchmark curve, the system **shall** use the yield of the shortest tenor.
    - If the bond's duration is greater than the longest tenor on the benchmark curve, the system **shall** use the yield of the longest tenor.
    - Extrapolation **shall not** be used.

### 4.9. Methodology: Market Context Calculation
- **Purpose:** To calculate broad market indicators using the benchmark curves available to the engine.
- **Calculations:**
    - **Yield Curve Slope (10Y-2Y):**
        - **Input:** `ust_benchmark_curve` (from `GeneralMarketData`)
        - **Logic:** Retrieve the 10-year yield (`Yield_10Y`) and the 2-year yield (`Yield_2Y`) from the curve.
        - **Formula:**
          $$ \text{Yield Curve Slope (10Y-2Y)} = \text{Yield}_{10Y} - \text{Yield}_{2Y} $$
    - **MMD/UST Ratio (10Y):**
        - **Inputs:** `ust_benchmark_curve`, `mmd_benchmark_curve` (from `GeneralMarketData`)
        - **Logic:** Retrieve the 10-year MMD yield (`MMD_Yield_10Y`) and the 10-year Treasury yield (`UST_Yield_10Y`).
        - **Formula:**
          $$ \text{MMD/UST Ratio (10Y)} = \frac{\text{MMD Yield}_{10Y}}{\text{UST Yield}_{10Y}} $$
    - **MUNI Fund Flows:**
        - **Input:** `GeneralMarketData.muni_fund_flows_net`
        - **Logic:** This value is passed through directly. If the input is not available or the instrument is not a MUNI, this field shall be null.
        - **Formula:** `market_context.muni_fund_flows_net = GeneralMarketData.muni_fund_flows_net`

### 4.10. Methodology: Downside Price Volatility Calculation
- **Purpose:** To calculate the realized downside volatility (or semi-deviation) of an instrument's returns over a trailing window. This metric quantifies downside risk by focusing only on negative price movements.
- **Inputs:**
  - `TradeHistory`: `array[object]` - The raw trade history for the lookback window.
  - `calculation_date` (`T`): `date` - The date for which the volatility is being calculated.
  - `lookback_window`: `integer` - The number of trading days to include in the calculation (e.g., 5, 20).

**Business Rule: Deriving Daily Closing Prices**
- **BR-19:** A daily closing price **shall** be derived from the `TradeHistory` data. For each trading day in the lookback period, the closing price is defined as the `price` of the last trade recorded on that calendar day. If no trades occurred on a given trading day, the closing price from the most recent previous day with a trade **shall** be carried forward.

- **Algorithm:**
  1.  **Derive Daily Price Series:** Following rule **BR-19**, process the `TradeHistory` input to generate a time-series of daily closing prices for the `lookback_window + 1` trading days ending on `calculation_date`. Let this series be `P`.
  2.  **Calculate Log Returns:** Create a new series, `R`, of `lookback_window` daily logarithmic returns:
      $$ R_t = \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right) $$
  3.  **Calculate Downside Volatility (Semi-Deviation):** The semi-deviation is calculated as the square root of the semi-variance. The semi-variance is the average of the squared deviations of returns that are below a target (in this case, zero).
      $$ \sigma_{\text{downside}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{r_i \in R, r_i < 0} (r_i)^2} $$
      Where:
      - `N` is the `lookback_window` size (the total number of returns in the period).
      - `r_i` are the individual log returns in the series `R`. The summation is only over returns less than zero.
      - We use `N-1` in the denominator for the sample-based calculation, which is standard practice to get an unbiased estimator of the variance.
- **Output:**
  - `downside_price_volatility`: `float` - The calculated trailing daily downside volatility.

**Business Rule: Populating `metric_type`**
- **BR-20:** The `metric_type` field for each `downside_price_volatility` object **shall** be populated with a string that clearly describes the calculation methodology.
  - For the 5-day calculation, the value **shall** be `"Trailing 5D Downside Volatility (Log-Returns)"`.
  - For the 20-day calculation, the value **shall** be `"Trailing 20D Downside Volatility (Log-Returns)"`.

### 4.11. Methodology: Security Details Enrichment
- **Purpose:** To enrich and structure the `security_details` object by mapping data from the `SecurityMaster` input and deriving new attributes based on business logic.
- **BR-21: `security_details` Population:** The fields within the `security_details` output object **shall** be populated as follows:
    - **Direct Mappings:**
        - `instrument_type`, `issuer_name`, `coupon_rate`, `maturity_date`, `sector`, `rating`, `state` **shall** be mapped directly from the corresponding fields in the `SecurityMaster` input.
    - **`tax_profile` Object:**
        - `tax_status` **shall** be mapped directly from `SecurityMaster`.
        - `de_minimis_issue` and `bank_qualified` **shall** be mapped directly from `SecurityMaster`.
        - `is_amt` **shall** be `true` if `SecurityMaster.tax_status` is 'AMT', otherwise `false`.
        - `in_state_tax_exempt` **shall** be `true` if `SecurityMaster.tax_status` is 'TAX_EXEMPT_FEDERAL_AND_STATE', otherwise `false`.
    - **`issuer_details` Object:**
        - `debt_service_coverage_ratio` and `is_dsr_covenant_breached` **shall** be mapped directly from `SecurityMaster`.
    - **`call_features` Object:**
        - `call_schedule` **shall** be mapped directly from `SecurityMaster`.
        - `is_callable` **shall** be `true` if `SecurityMaster.call_schedule` is not null and contains at least one entry; otherwise `false`.
        - `next_call_date` **shall** be the earliest `call_date` from the `call_schedule` that is after the `calculation_context.as_of_date`. If no future call dates exist, this field **shall** be null.
        - `next_call_price` **shall** be the `call_price` corresponding to the `next_call_date`. If `next_call_date` is null, this field **shall** be null.

### 4.12. Methodology: Supplemental Data Calculation

#### 4.12.1. Cross-Asset Correlation
- **Purpose (Trader View):** To understand the instrument's systematic risk and how it behaves relative to broader market benchmarks. A high correlation to a risk asset (like a high-yield ETF) indicates it may not provide diversification benefits in a market sell-off.
- **Inputs:**
    - A 60-trading-day time series of the instrument's daily total returns, derived from its price history.
    - A 60-trading-day time series of a benchmark's daily total returns.
- **Logic:**
    1.  Select the appropriate `benchmark_ticker` based on **Business Rule BR-22**.
    2.  Calculate the 60-day Pearson correlation coefficient between the instrument's return series and the benchmark's return series.
- **BR-22:** The `benchmark_ticker` for correlation calculation **shall** be selected based on the instrument's `instrument_type` and `rating` classification:
    - For `instrument_type` = 'TFI_CORPORATE' and a rating corresponding to Investment Grade (Scale Value 1-10 in the rating scale), the ticker **shall** be **LQD**.
    - For `instrument_type` = 'TFI_CORPORATE' and a rating corresponding to High Yield (Scale Value > 10), the ticker **shall** be **HYG**.
    - For `instrument_type` = 'MUNI', the ticker **shall** be **MUB**.
    - For `instrument_type` in ('TFI_TREASURY', 'TFI_AGENCY'), the ticker **shall** be **GOVT**.
- **Formula (Pearson Correlation):**
    $$ \rho(R_{\text{bond}}, R_{\text{bench}}) = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_{\text{bond}}, R_{\text{bench}})}{\sigma_{R_{\text{bond}}} \cdot \sigma_{R_{\text{bench}}}} $$

### 4.13. Methodology: Duration Calculation
- **Purpose:** To calculate the interest rate sensitivity of the bond. Two types of duration are calculated based on whether the bond has embedded options. The duration calculation must be performed after YTM/YTW calculation but before calculations that depend on duration (OAS, CS01, Benchmark Yield Interpolation).
- **BR-23 (Duration Calculation Selection):**
  - For bonds where `security_details.call_features.is_callable` is `false`, `modified_duration` **shall** be calculated and populated. `effective_duration` **shall** be set to `null`.
  - For bonds where `security_details.call_features.is_callable` is `true`, `effective_duration` **shall** be calculated and populated. `modified_duration` **shall** be set to `null`.

#### 4.13.1. Modified Duration
- **Applicability:** Option-free bonds.
- **Formula:**
  $$ \text{Modified Duration} = \frac{1}{\text{Market Price} \times (1 + y)} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{t \cdot C_t}{(1+y)^t} + \frac{N \cdot \text{FV}}{(1+y)^N} \right] $$
  Where:
  - `y` = Yield to Maturity (YTM) / payment_frequency
  - `C_t` = Coupon payment at period t
  - `FV` = Face Value
  - `N` = Total number of periods
  - `Market_Price` = Current market price of the bond

#### 4.13.2. Effective Duration
- **Applicability:** Bonds with embedded options (e.g., callable bonds).
- **Formula:**
  $$ \text{Effective Duration} = \frac{P(-\Delta y) - P(+\Delta y)}{2 \times P_0 \times \Delta y} $$
  Where:
  - `P_0` = The initial market price of the bond.
  - `\Delta y` = A small change in yield (e.g., 10 basis points or 0.001).
  - `P(-\Delta y)` = The bond's theoretical price if yields decrease by `\Delta y`.
  - `P(+\Delta y)` = The bond's theoretical price if yields increase by `\Delta y`.
- **Calculation Logic:** The prices `P(-\Delta y)` and `P(+\Delta y)` **shall** be calculated using the same binomial interest rate lattice model described in Section 4.6 (OAS Calculation). The model must account for the bond's call features to correctly price the bond under different interest rate scenarios.

## 5. Functional Requirements: Feature Calculation
- **FR-04:** The system **shall** calculate the instrument's **Price** as the mid-point of Bid/Ask, or the last traded price if bid/ask is unavailable.
  - **Formula:**
    $$ \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Bid Price} + \text{Ask Price}}{2} $$
    If `Bid_Price` or `Ask_Price` is unavailable, `Price = Last_Trade_Price`.

- **FR-05:** The system **shall** calculate **Yield to Maturity (YTM)** as the internal rate of return (IRR) solving for the yield given the current price and all cash flows to maturity.
  - **Formula:** Solve for `y` in the equation:
    $$ \text{Market Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{C_t}{(1 + y/f)^{t}} + \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1 + y/f)^{N}} $$
    - `C_t`: Coupon payment at time `t`
    - `y`: Yield to Maturity (annualized)
    - `f`: Payment frequency per year
    - `N`: Total number of periods to maturity
    - `t`: Period when cash flow is received

- **FR-06:** The system **shall** calculate **Yield to Call (YTC)** as the IRR solving for yield to each specific call date and call price.
  - **Formula:** For each call date in the `call_schedule`, solve for `y_c` in the equation:
    $$ \text{Market Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{N_c} \frac{C_t}{(1 + y_c/f)^{t}} + \frac{\text{Call Price}}{(1 + y_c/f)^{N_c}} $$
    - `y_c`: Yield to Call (annualized)
    - `N_c`: Total number of periods to the call date
    - `Call_Price`: The price at which the bond can be called

- **FR-07:** The system **shall** calculate **Yield to Worst (YTW)** as the minimum of the calculated YTM and all calculated YTCs.
  - **Formula:**
    $$ \text{YTW} = \min(\text{YTM}, \text{YTC}_1, \text{YTC}_2, \dots, \text{YTC}_n) $$

- **FR-08:** The system **shall** calculate **DV01** as the price change of the bond given a one basis point (0.01%) decrease in yield.
  - **Formula:**
    $$ \text{DV01} = |\text{Price}(y - 0.0001) - \text{Price}(y)| $$
    where `y` is the bond's current **Yield to Worst (YTW)**.

- **FR-09:** The system **shall** calculate **CS01** as the price change of the bond given a one basis point (0.01%) increase in its relevant credit spread.
  - **Formula Logic:** CS01 measures price sensitivity to credit spread changes. Its calculation requires re-pricing the bond after widening the spread by 1 basis point. The methodology varies by `instrument_type`.
    1.  **For `instrument_type` = 'TFI_CORPORATE':**
        - The calculation measures sensitivity to a 1bp shift in the `sector_credit_spread_curve`.
        - **a. Decompose Yield:** A corporate bond's yield (`YTW`) is composed of the benchmark yield, a sector-level credit spread, and an issuer-specific spread.
        - **b. Get Benchmark & Sector Spreads:** Calculate the `Interpolated_Benchmark_Yield` (Section 4.8) and the `Interpolated_Sector_Spread` by interpolating the `sector_credit_spread_curve` at the bond's duration.
        - **c. Calculate New Discount Rate:** The new rate for re-pricing is `YTW + 0.0001`, which represents the benchmark yield, the issuer-specific spread, and the sector spread widened by 1bp.
    2.  **For all other instrument types:**
        - **a. Get Benchmark Yield:** Calculate the `Interpolated_Benchmark_Yield` (Section 4.8).
        - **b. Calculate Implied Credit Spread:** `Initial_Spread = YTW - Interpolated_Benchmark_Yield`.
        - **c. Calculate New Discount Rate:** `New_Discount_Rate = Interpolated_Benchmark_Yield + Initial_Spread + 0.0001`.
    3.  **Calculate Price_New:** Calculate a new theoretical price for the bond by discounting all of its cash flows using the appropriate `New_Discount_Rate`.
    4.  **Calculate CS01:** The CS01 value is the absolute difference between the bond's current market price and the new theoretical price.
        $$ \text{CS01} = |\text{Market Price} - \text{Price}_{\text{New}}| $$

- **FR-10:** The system **shall** calculate **Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)** as per the methodology in Section 4.6.

- **FR-11:** The system **shall** calculate **Relative Value** against the appropriate benchmark (MMD or UST) by subtracting the benchmark yield at the same duration from the bond's YTW.
  - **Formula:**
    $$ \text{Relative Value (bps)} = (\text{YTW} - \text{Interpolated Benchmark Yield}) \times 10000 $$
    The benchmark yield is interpolated to match the bond's duration as per the methodology in Section 4.8.

- **FR-12:** The system **shall** calculate **Relative Value** against the identified peer group by subtracting the average OAS of the peer group from the bond's OAS.
  - **Formula:**
    $$ \text{Relative Value vs Peers (bps)} = \text{OAS}_{\text{bond}} - \text{AVG}(\text{OAS}_{\text{peer}_1}, \dots, \text{OAS}_{\text{peer}_n}) $$

- **FR-12a:** For `instrument_type` = 'TFI_CORPORATE', the system **shall** calculate **Relative Value vs. Sector** by calculating the issuer's spread over its interpolated sector curve.
  - **Formula:**
    $$ \text{vs\_sector\_bps} = (\text{YTW} - \text{Interpolated Benchmark Yield} - \text{Interpolated Sector Spread}) \times 10000 $$
    The sector spread is interpolated from the `sector_credit_spread_curve` at the bond's duration. This field shall be null for non-corporate instruments.

- **FR-13:** The system **shall** calculate a composite **Liquidity Score** based on the formula in Section 4.5.

- **FR-14:** The system **shall** produce a **Trade History Summary** by aggregating raw trade data as per the methodology in Section 4.7.

- **FR-15:** The system **shall** calculate the **Bid/Ask Spread in BPS**.
  - **Formula:**
    $$ \text{Bid-Ask Spread (bps)} = \frac{\text{Ask Price} - \text{Bid Price}}{\frac{\text{Ask Price} + \text{Bid Price}}{2}} \times 10000 $$

- **FR-16:** The system **shall** calculate **Market Context** indicators as per the methodology in Section 4.9.

- **FR-18:** The system **shall** calculate trailing **Downside Price Volatility** for 5-day and 20-day lookback windows, populating `downside_price_volatility_5d` and `downside_price_volatility_20d` respectively, as per the methodology in Section 4.10.

- **FR-19:** The system **shall** populate the `relative_value.peer_group_cusips` field with the list of CUSIPs identified in the peer group process (Section 4.4) and the `relative_value.peer_group_size` field with the count of that list.

- **FR-20:** The system **shall** populate the **Security Details** object as per the enrichment methodology in Section 4.11.

- **FR-21:** The system **shall** calculate the **Cross-Asset Correlation** as per the methodology in Section 4.12.
