    - [X] 4.3: Train and evaluate the regime predictor.
    - [X] 4.4: Implement feature importance layer for interpretability.
- [X] 005: Develop Model 2: Adaptive Risk Scoring (N-BEATS/DeepAR).
    - [X] 5.1: Implement data preprocessing for security parameters, trade details, dealer behavior, market context.
    - [X] 5.2: Implement regime-specific N-BEATS/DeepAR models.
    - [X] 5.3: Implement Dynamic Meta-Learner for model integration.
    - [X] 5.4: Implement confidence calibration (conformal prediction).
    - [X] 5.5: Train and evaluate the adaptive risk scoring model.
    - [X] 5.6: Implement logic for generating risk factors, historical scenarios, and mitigations.
