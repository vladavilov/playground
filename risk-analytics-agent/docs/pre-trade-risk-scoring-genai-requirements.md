# Business Requirements Document: Pre-Trade Risk Scoring with GenAI

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive business requirements for implementing a GenAI-powered Pre-Trade Risk Scoring system for municipal bonds and taxable fixed income products. The system will utilize historical trade data, security parameters, and market context to provide accurate risk assessments before trade execution, adapting to current market regimes.

The architecture clearly separates responsibilities between an external Financial Trading Platform (which provides market and trade data) and the GenAI Risk Scoring System (which analyzes the data and produces risk assessments).

## 2. System Purpose and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Purpose
Develop a two-stage GenAI solution that:
1. Accurately identifies current market regimes
2. Provides comprehensive pre-trade risk scoring adapted to the identified regime
3. Exposes complex, non-linear interactions between risk factors
4. Delivers actionable insights to traders in real-time

### 2.2 Key Objectives
- Generate risk scores (0-100) for potential trades before execution
- Identify specific risk factors contributing to the score
- Adapt risk assessments to current market conditions
- Provide comparative historical scenarios
- Suggest risk mitigation strategies
- Deliver sub-second response times for trade evaluation

## 6. Key Risk Factor Interactions and Formulas

### 6.1 Complex Interaction Categories

| Interaction Category | Description | Formula Components |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Liquidity × Market Direction | Asymmetric liquidity behavior in different market directions | Liquidity metrics, market momentum, trade direction |
| Credit Quality × Market Volatility | Non-linear relationship between credit quality and price pressure during volatility | Credit ratings, spread volatility, market regime |
| Duration × Liquidity × Market Direction | Compounding effects of duration and liquidity in directional markets | Modified duration, liquidity score, rate movement |
| Dealer Inventory × Issue Size × Recent Issuance | Supply-demand dynamics affecting specific securities | Dealer positions, outstanding size, primary calendar |
| Tax Status × Seasonal Factors × Fund Flows | Tax-driven behavioral effects on specific security types | Tax status, calendar position, fund flow data |
| Call Options × Interest Rate Environment × Issuer Quality | Refinancing behavior and option value changes | Call features, rate environment, issuer rating |

### 6.2 Key Mathematical Formulas

#### 6.2.1 Liquidity-Adjusted Risk Score

$$
\text{LiquidityRiskScore} = \text{BaseScore} \times \left(1 + \beta \times \frac{\text{TradeSize}}{\text{AvgDailyVolume}} \times e^{\alpha \times \text{MarketDirectionFactor}}\right)
$$

Where:
- $\text{BaseScore}$ is the initial risk assessment
- $\beta$ is the liquidity sensitivity parameter (regime-dependent)
- $\alpha$ is the market direction sensitivity (higher in selloffs)
- $\text{MarketDirectionFactor}$ is negative in selloffs, positive in rallies

#### 6.2.2 Credit-Volatility Adjustment

$$
\text{CreditVolRisk} = \text{BaseRisk} \times \left(1 + \gamma \times (10 - \text{NumericRating})^2 \times \frac{\text{CurrentVol}}{\text{HistoricalAvgVol}}\right)
$$

Where:
- $\text{NumericRating}$ converts alphanumeric ratings to numeric (AAA=10, AA+=9, etc.)
- $\gamma$ is the credit sensitivity parameter (regime-dependent)
- $\text{CurrentVol}$ is the current market volatility
- $\text{HistoricalAvgVol}$ is the long-term average volatility

#### 6.2.3 Duration-Liquidity Compound Risk

$$
\text{DurationLiquidityRisk} = \text{Duration} \times \text{LiquidityScore} \times \left(1 + \delta \times \text{MarketDirectionFactor} \times \text{RateMovementExp}\right)
$$

Where:
- $\text{Duration}$ is the modified duration
- $\text{LiquidityScore}$ is the standardized liquidity measure (0-1)
- $\delta$ is the compounding factor (regime-dependent)
- $\text{RateMovementExp}$ is the expected rate movement in the current regime

#### 6.2.4 Call Option Risk Assessment

$$
\text{CallOptionRisk} = \text{CallProbability} \times \frac{\text{CurrentPrice} - \text{CallPrice}}{\text{CallPrice}}
$$

Where $\text{CallProbability}$ is calculated as:

$$
\text{CallProbability} = \text{min}\left(0.95, \text{max}\left(0.05, \Phi\left(\frac{\text{RefRate} - \text{CouponRate} + \theta \times \text{CreditSpread}}{\sigma_{\text{rates}} \times \sqrt{\text{TimeToCall}}}\right)\right)\right)
$$

Where:
- $\Phi$ is the cumulative normal distribution function
- $\text{RefRate}$ is the reference rate for comparable maturity
- $\theta$ is the issuer quality factor
- $\sigma_{\text{rates}}$ is the rate volatility

#### 6.2.5 Composite Risk Score Calculation

$$
\text{CompositeRiskScore} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i(\text{regime}) \times \text{RiskFactor}_i
$$

Where:
- $w_i(\text{regime})$ are the regime-dependent weights for each risk factor
- $\text{RiskFactor}_i$ are the individual risk components
- $n$ is the number of risk factors considered

| Rate-Driven | 0.25 | 0.30 | 0.25 | 0.20 |
| Strong Inflow | 0.30 | 0.20 | 0.20 | 0.30 |
| Technical Dislocation | 0.20 | 0.25 | 0.40 | 0.15 |

#### 11.2.2 Price Impact Estimation

$$
\text{EstimatedPriceImpact} = \alpha \times \left( \frac{\text{TradeSize}}{\text{AvgDailyVolume}} \right)^\beta \times \text{VolatilityAdjustment} \times \text{RegimeFactor}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ is the base impact coefficient (calibrated from historical data)
- $\beta$ is the non-linear scaling factor (typically 0.5-0.8)
- $\text{VolatilityAdjustment} = \frac{\text{CurrentVolatility}}{\text{HistoricalAvgVolatility}}$
- $\text{RegimeFactor}$ varies by market regime (higher in stressed regimes)

#### 11.2.3 Expected Holding Period Risk

$$
\text{HoldingPeriodRisk} = \text{Position} \times \text{Duration} \times \text{DailyVolatility} \times \sqrt{\text{ExpectedHoldingDays}} \times \text{RegimeScalar}
$$

Where:
- $\text{Position}$ is the trade size in par amount
- $\text{ExpectedHoldingDays}$ is estimated based on security characteristics and historical patterns
- $\text{RegimeScalar}$ adjusts the risk estimate based on current market regime

### 11.6 Storage Optimization for Time-Series Data

Efficient storage strategies will be implemented to handle the large volumes of historical market data, security metrics, and trade information while maintaining query performance.

#### 11.6.1 Time-Series Compression Techniques

1. **Delta Encoding**:
   - Store differences between successive values rather than absolute values
   - Particularly effective for slowly changing metrics (bid-ask spreads, liquidity scores)
   - Typical compression ratio: 5:1 to 10:1 for market data

2. **Lossy Compression for Historical Data**:
   - Progressive downsampling based on age:
     - Full granularity for most recent 30 days
     - 5-minute aggregation for 30-90 days
     - Hourly aggregation for 90-365 days
     - Daily aggregation beyond 1 year
   - Maintain summary statistics (min, max, mean, std) for each aggregation period
   - Exception flagging for significant market events (preserve full granularity)

3. **Column-oriented Storage**:
   - Leveraging time-series similarity within columns
   - Dictionary encoding for categorical variables
   - Run-length encoding for sparse changes
   - Bitmap indexing for efficient filtering

#### 11.6.2 Partitioning Strategy

```plantuml
@startuml

rectangle "Time-Series Data" as TSD

rectangle "Time Partitioning" as TP {
  rectangle "Daily Partitions" as DP
  rectangle "Monthly Partitions" as MP
  rectangle "Yearly Partitions" as YP
}

rectangle "Vertical Partitioning" as VP {
  rectangle "High-Frequency Metrics" as HFM
  rectangle "Medium-Frequency Metrics" as MFM
  rectangle "Low-Frequency Metrics" as LFM
}

rectangle "Security-Based Partitioning" as SBP {
  rectangle "By Sector" as BS
  rectangle "By Liquidity Tier" as BLT
  rectangle "By Geographic Region" as BGR
}

TSD --> TP
TSD --> VP
TSD --> SBP

@enduml
```

1. **Multi-level Temporal Partitioning**:
   - Daily partitions for most recent data (30 days)
   - Monthly partitions for medium-term data (1-12 months)
   - Yearly partitions for historical data (>1 year)
   - Partition pruning for query optimization

2. **Attribute-based Partitioning**:
   - Security characteristics (sector, maturity bucket, rating category)
   - Query pattern optimization (most frequent query dimensions)
   - Balanced partition sizes to avoid hotspots

3. **Update Frequency Partitioning**:
   - Separate storage for different update frequencies
   - Minimizes write amplification
   - Improves read performance by isolating hot data

#### 11.6.3 Storage Tiering Implementation

1. **Hot Tier**:
   - Most recent 30 days of market data and security metrics
   - High-performance SSD storage
   - In-memory caching layer for active securities
   - Sub-millisecond access times
   - Optimized for real-time inference and recent historical analysis

2. **Warm Tier**:
   - 1-12 months of historical data
   - Balanced performance/cost storage
   - Column-oriented format with moderate compression
   - 10-100ms access times
   - Used for model training and medium-term analysis

3. **Cold Tier**:
   - Data older than 12 months
   - Object storage with high compression
   - Heavily aggregated with selective preservation of important events
   - 1-10s access times acceptable
   - Used for long-term pattern analysis and regulatory compliance

4. **Automated Data Migration**:
   - Age-based migration policies
   - Access-pattern based retention in higher tiers
   - Pre-emptive warming based on scheduled analysis jobs

#### 11.6.4 Query Optimization Techniques

1. **Materialized Views**:
   - Pre-computed aggregates for common analysis patterns
   - Time-based rollups (daily, weekly, monthly summaries)
   - Security-based aggregations
   - Regime-specific metric calculations

2. **Approximate Query Processing**:
   - Sampling-based approximation for large historical queries
   - Error bounds guarantees for approximate results
   - Progressive query refinement for interactive analysis

3. **Time-Series Specific Indexing**:
   - Temporal indices for range-based queries
   - Multi-dimensional indices for combined filtering
   - Bitmap indices for high-cardinality dimensions

This comprehensive storage optimization strategy will reduce storage costs by 60-80% while maintaining query performance within SLA requirements for both real-time inference and historical analysis.

## 20. Appendix: Sample Calculations

### Appendix A: Example Risk Score Calculation

For a sample municipal bond with the following characteristics:
- AA-rated general obligation bond
- 5-year maturity
- 3.75% coupon
- Modified duration of 4.2
- Average daily volume of $2M
- Current bid-ask spread of 5 bps
- Proposed trade size of $10M (sell)
- Current market regime: Volatility-Driven Risk-Off (75% probability), Rate-Driven Selloff (25% probability)

The risk score would be calculated as follows:

1. **Base Risk Calculations**:

   Duration Risk:
   $$\text{DurationRisk} = 4.2 \times 3.5 \text{ (volatility factor)} = 14.7$$

   Liquidity Risk:
   $$\text{LiquidityRisk} = \frac{10M}{2M} \times 0.8 \text{ (size factor)} \times 1.3 \text{ (regime factor)} = 5.2$$

   Credit Risk:
   $$\text{CreditRisk} = (10 - 8) \text{ (rating numeric)} \times 1.2 \text{ (regime factor)} = 2.4$$

2. **Interaction Effects**:

   Duration-Liquidity Interaction:
   $$\text{DurationLiquidityEffect} = 14.7 \times 5.2 \times 0.03 \text{ (interaction coefficient)} = 2.3$$

   Credit-Volatility Interaction:
   $$\text{CreditVolatilityEffect} = 2.4 \times 3.5 \text{ (volatility)} \times 0.25 \text{ (coefficient)} = 2.1$$

3. **Regime-Specific Calculations**:

   Volatility-Regime Risk:
   $$\text{VolatilityRegimeScore} = (14.7 + 5.2 + 2.4 + 2.3 + 2.1) \times 1.15 \text{ (regime adjuster)} = 30.8$$

   Rate-Selloff-Regime Risk:
   $$\text{RateSelloffRegimeScore} = (14.7 + 5.2 + 2.4 + 2.3 + 2.1) \times 1.25 \text{ (regime adjuster)} = 33.4$$

4. **Composite Risk Score**:
   $$\text{CompositeRiskScore} = 0.75 \times 30.8 + 0.25 \times 33.4 = 31.5$$

5. **Normalized 0-100 Score**:
   $$\text{NormalizedScore} = \text{min}(100, \text{max}(0, 31.5 \times 2.2)) = 69$$

The final risk score would be 69 out of 100, with the primary contributors being duration risk and liquidity risk, amplified by the current volatility-driven risk-off regime.
